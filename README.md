# coffee_shop_application_java

Coffee shop application designed using OOP principles in April 2024.

Notes:
- Developed using openjdk version "21.0.2".  The program will not run in a github Codespace as is.


Thoughts for Future Improvements:
- This program uses a csv file as a persistent database for order the order history.  A more advanced database solution is an obvious extension of this program.
- Adding features for the GUI, including a counter on the homepage for how many unfilled orders remain.
- Adapting features to more closely mimic the real-world environment.  For example, the payment portion of ordering feels somewhat awkward as is.
